# London Bridge

The London Bridge crosses the River Thames in London, England. There has been a bridge in this location for almost 2,000 years!

The first London Bridge was built by the Ancient Romans around 50 AD. They constructed a wooden bridge to connect the north and south banks of the Thames.

Over the centuries, this bridge was destroyed by fire, storms, and attacks many times. New wooden bridges were quickly built, but did not last long.

In the 1100s AD, the first stone London Bridge was built. It had over 20 arches and buildings like houses, shops, and a chapel constructed right on top!

The famous nursery rhyme "London Bridge is Falling Down" tells how the bridge collapsed and was rebuilt many times. Today a concrete bridge stands where the Romans first built almost 2,000 years ago!
