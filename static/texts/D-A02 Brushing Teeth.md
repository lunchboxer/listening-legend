# Brushing your teeth

Brushing your teeth is very important for your oral health. It helps you keep your teeth and gums clean and healthy. It also prevents bad breath and cavities. Cavities are holes in your teeth that are caused by bacteria and sugar. You should brush your teeth twice a day, in the morning and at night, with a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Fluoride is a mineral that makes your teeth stronger and protects them from decay.

When you brush your teeth, you should follow these steps: First, wet your toothbrush and put a pea-sized amount of toothpaste on it. Second, hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums and gently move it back and forth in short strokes. Third, brush the outer, inner, and chewing surfaces of all your teeth. Fourth, brush your tongue to remove bacteria and freshen your breath. Fifth, spit out the toothpaste and rinse your mouth with water. Sixth, replace your toothbrush every three or four months, or when the bristles are worn out.
