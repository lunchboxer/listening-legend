# Knights

Hundreds of years ago, knights were warriors who protected kingdoms and lords in Europe. They lived by a code of honor called chivalry.

Knights wore metal armor to protect themselves in battle. They carried swords and weapons on powerful horses. Training to become a knight began at age 7 and took many years to complete.

When young noblemen turned 21, they took an oath to serve others and defend the weak. Then in a ceremony, the new knight was given a sword. After proving themselves in tournaments and battles, knights could earn lands and titles.

Stories of brave knights fighting dragons and monsters were very popular. Knights influenced flags, poems, paintings, and more. Their legacy lives on in films, books, and games today.
