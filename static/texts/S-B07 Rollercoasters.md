# Rollercoasters

Rollercoasters are exciting amusement park rides. They have cars that hold riders and run on steep, twisting tracks. The tracks have big ups, downs, loops, and turns. This gives riders a thrilling ride!

Rollercoasters use gravity and speed to work. They slowly climb up the first hill on the track. At the top, gravity pulls the cars fast down the steep drop. The speed whips the cars around corners and over more hills along the track. Rollercoasters are fast and fun!
