They were interested in flying since they were young, and they learned a lot from reading books and magazines about aviation. They also experimented with kites, gliders, and bicycles, and they built their own wind tunnel to test their designs.

The flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet. They made three more flights that day, each one longer than the previous one. The longest flight was 59 seconds and 852 feet.
