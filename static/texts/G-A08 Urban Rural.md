# Urban versus Rural Life

People's lives are different in urban and rural areas. Urban areas are cities and towns. Rural areas are countryside and small villages. In cities, millions of people live close together. Houses and apartments are next to each other. People rely on public transportation like buses, subways and taxis to get around. There are skyscrapers, museums, restaurants and crowds.

In rural areas, houses are far apart on larger pieces of land. Many people have big yards and gardens. They drive their own cars, trucks and tractors to get around. Rural life has more nature, such as forests, farms and wildlife. People know their neighbors because there are fewer people. Life tends to be slower paced.
