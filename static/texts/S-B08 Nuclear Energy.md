# Nuclear Energy

Nuclear energy comes from the splitting of atoms inside a power plant. The splitting makes heat that boils water. The steam from the boiling water spins large turbines to make electricity.

Nuclear power plants provide lots of energy for cities and factories. But they must be built carefully. The uranium in the plants is radioactive. This means it gives off radiation that can be dangerous. The plants have thick walls and many safety rules. This protects people from the radiation.
