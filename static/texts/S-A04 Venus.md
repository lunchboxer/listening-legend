# Venus

Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and the brightest one in the sky. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. Venus is sometimes called Earth's sister, because it is almost the same size and shape as Earth. But Venus is very different from Earth in other ways.

Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. It has a thick atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide, which traps heat like a blanket. The temperature on Venus can reach up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hot enough to melt metal. Venus also has clouds of sulfuric acid, which can burn your skin. Venus has no moon, and it spins backwards, so the sun rises in the west and sets in the east.
