# Growing a Vegetable Garden

In the spring, it's fun to grow a vegetable garden. First, I dig up the dirt and make neat rows. I poke little holes in the dirt with my finger. Then I put a seed in each hole. Everyday I water the seeds and pull the weeds. Soon I see little green shoots peeking through the ground. The shoots grow bigger and turn into plants. On the tomato plants, small yellow flowers bloom. Bees fly around the flowers. The flowers fall off, and tiny tomatoes grow. On the pea plants, I can pick crunchy peas inside the pods. All summer long I get yummy vegetables from my garden to eat. Taking care of a garden is hard work, but it's worth it!
