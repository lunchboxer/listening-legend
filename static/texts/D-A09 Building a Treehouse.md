# Building a Treehouse

Building a treehouse is a fun project for the whole family. First, you must pick a good tree. Look for a healthy tree with strong branches wide enough to hold a treehouse. Oak, maple or ash trees work well. Next, plan out your design. Draw sketches to bring your ideas to life. Gather building supplies like wood, nails, power tools, and rope. Make sure to have an adult handle the more dangerous tools.

Now the fun part - start building! Use wood to construct the floor in sections up in the tree branches. The walls and railings around the treehouse are next. You’ll need a ladder for climbing up and down too. Add a roof to help the inside stay dry on rainy and sunny days. Then decorate! Paint the walls, add carpet, hang lights and curtains. To finish, add toys, books, and art supplies to play with. Building a treehouse takes time and hard work. But soon you’ll have an awesome secret hangout spot to enjoy for years.
