# Snow

Snow is frozen water that falls from the sky. Snow is made of tiny ice crystals that stick together. Snow crystals have six sides and many different shapes. Some look like stars, some look like needles, and some look like plates. No two snow crystals are exactly the same.

Snow can be fun to play with. You can make snowmen, snowballs, and snow angels. You can also go sledding, skiing, and snowboarding. But snow can also be dangerous.
