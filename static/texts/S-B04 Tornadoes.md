# Tornadoes

A tornado is a strong, spinning wind that forms a column from a cloud to the ground. Tornadoes look like giant, grey, funnel-shaped clouds. Tornadoes can travel long distances. Some have been known to travel over 200 miles. However, 5 miles is more common.

Tornadoes are very dangerous. They can destroy buildings, bridges, cars, and trees. They can also hurt people and animals. The wind inside a tornado can be faster than a race car. Scientists use a scale called the Enhanced Fujita Scale to measure how strong a tornado is. The scale goes from EF0 to EF5, with EF5 being the strongest.

Tornadoes form when warm, humid air meets cold, dry air. This makes the air spin and rise. The spinning air becomes a funnel cloud. When the funnel cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado. Tornadoes usually happen in spring and summer, when the air is warm and moist. Tornadoes are most common in the United States, especially in a region called Tornado Alley.
