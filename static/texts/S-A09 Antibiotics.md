# Antibiotics

Antibiotics are medicines that help fight bacterial infections. They work by killing bacteria or stopping them from growing and spreading. Some common antibiotics are penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalosporins. Doctors prescribe antibiotics to treat illnesses like strep throat, pneumonia and skin infections.

Antibiotics only work on bacteria, not viruses. They can cure strep throat which is caused by bacteria, but not the common cold which is a virus. It is important to only use antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor. Overuse can lead to antibiotic resistance, where bacteria change and antibiotics no longer work on them.

To avoid resistance, you should always finish your full antibiotic prescription. Never take antibiotics that were not prescribed for you or share yours with others. Wash your hands regularly and get recommended vaccines to help prevent infections in the first place. Using antibiotics wisely ensures they will keep working when we really need them.
