# The Public Pool

It's finally summer, so my family goes swimming at the public pool. We have to sign in and take showers before entering the pool area. My favorite thing is the water slide! I climb up the steps, sit at the top, and zoom into the pool. It feels like I'm flying!

After going down the slide a few times, I swim over to the shallow end. Here, I practice floating on my back and kicking across the pool. My dad shows me how to hold my breath and dive under the water. Before we leave, my brother and I play with dive rings and splash each other. We always have a fun day at the pool!
