# Rosa Parks

Rosa Parks was a brave woman who fought for the rights of black people in the United States. She lived in a time when black people and white people were not treated equally. They had to use different things and places, like schools, buses, and water fountains. This was called segregation, and it was very wrong.

One day, in 1955, Rosa Parks was riding a bus home from work. She sat in a seat that was for black people. But when the bus got full, the driver told her to move and give her seat to a white person. Rosa Parks said no. She was tired of being treated badly. She was arrested for breaking the law, but her action started a big protest. Many black people stopped riding the buses until the law was changed. Rosa Parks became a hero of the civil rights movement.
