# The History of Pizza

Pizza originated in Italy hundreds of years ago. In the late 1800s, people in Naples began making pizza with tomatoes, cheese, and basil. The dish became very popular in Italy, especially in Naples.

In the early 1900s, many Italians moved to the United States. They brought recipes for pizza with them. The first pizzeria in the U.S. opened in New York City in 1905. After World War II, American soldiers who were stationed in Italy returned home with a taste for pizza. This helped make pizza popular across America.
