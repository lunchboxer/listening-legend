# The Silk Road

The Silk Road was an ancient trade route from China to Europe, over 4,000 miles long.

The route began around 200 BC during the Han Dynasty. Chinese merchants went west trading silk and spices while Romans traveled east.

Along the Silk Road, merchants stopped to trade. Ideas, cultures, foods were shared between East and West.
