# The Beach Trip

Lily and Jake were very excited to go to the beach with their parents. They had been waiting for this day for a long time. They packed their swimsuits, towels, sunscreen, hats, and sunglasses. They also brought a bucket, a shovel, and a kite. They wanted to have fun in the sun and the sand.

They arrived at the beach and found a nice spot to set up their umbrella and chairs. Lily and Jake put on their sunscreen and ran to the water. They splashed and played in the waves, laughing and having a great time. They tried to catch fish and crabs in the water. They also collected shells and rocks which they used to decorate the sandcastle they made with their bucket and shovel. They flew their kite in the sky, and watched it soar and dance in the wind.

Lily and Jake had a wonderful day at the beach. They enjoyed the warm sun, the cool water, and the soft sand. They had fun with their parents and each other. They took pictures and memories with them, and they hoped to come back again soon.
