# Making Pizza

Making a pizza with my family is so much fun! First, we roll out the dough into a big circle. Then we spread tomato sauce over the dough with a spoon. Next, we sprinkle on salty cheese that melts when it bakes. I put on my favorite toppings like pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives. My dad helps me make a smiley face out of slices of bell pepper. We bake the pizza until the cheese gets bubbly and the crust turns golden brown. When itâ€™s done, we slice up the pizza and enjoy eating our yummy creation! We end our pizza night by playing board games together as a family.
