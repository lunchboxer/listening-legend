# Penguins

Penguins are fun birds that live in very cold places. Most penguins live in Antarctica. Antarctica is covered in snow and ice. It is cold there all year long! Penguins have special feathers called plumage that keep them warm. Their black and white plumage helps camouflage them from predators.
