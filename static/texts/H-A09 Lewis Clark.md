# Lewis and Clark

In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson bought a large amount of land from France called the Louisiana Territory. Jeffereson wanted to explore this new land which stretched from the Mississippi River all the way to the Rocky Mountains!

Jefferson chose his personal secretary, Meriwether Lewis, to lead an expedition. Lewis asked his friend William Clark to come along too. Lewis and Clark gathered a group of soldiers, hunters, and guides. In 1804, they left St. Louis, Missouri and headed west in boats along the Missouri River.

Lewis and Clark had to pass through rugged mountains and vast plains on their 8,000 mile round trip journey. They met Native American tribes along the way, some friendly and some hostile. After over 2 years of travel, they finally reached the Pacific Ocean in 1806. Lewis and Clark drew maps and kept journals describing the amazing new lands, plants, and animals they encountered. Their journey provided the first description of the American West.
