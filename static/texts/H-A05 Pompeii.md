# Pompeii

Pompeii was an ancient city in Italy that was buried by a volcano in 79 CE. The volcano was called Mount Vesuvius, and it erupted with a huge explosion that sent ash, rocks, and gas into the air. The people of Pompeii did not know that the volcano was dangerous, and they were not prepared for the disaster. Many of them died from the heat, the smoke, or the falling debris.

The city of Pompeii was forgotten for many years, until it was discovered by archaeologists in the 1700s. They found that the ash had preserved the city and its people very well. They could see the buildings, the streets, the art, and the everyday objects that the people used. They could also make casts of the people's bodies by filling the hollow spaces in the ash with plaster. The city of Pompeii is like a time capsule that shows us how the ancient Romans lived.
