# Kites

Kites have been around for a very long time. Over 2,500 years ago, people in China made kites by stretching silk over a bamboo frame. These early kites were simple, often shaped like a bird or a dragon.

The Chinese used kites for more than fun. Kites helped them test the wind for sailing, signal warnings, and even fly soldiers up in the air for a better view! Over time, kites spread around the world. New shapes and frames were created. Today we have many different types of kites to enjoy.
