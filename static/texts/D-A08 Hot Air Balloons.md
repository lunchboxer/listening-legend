# Hot Air Balloons

Hot air balloons are amazing to watch float through the sky. They use hot air to rise up in the air. A balloon has a large fabric bag called an envelope. Attached below is a basket to hold passengers. The envelope is filled with regular air first. Then the pilot uses propane burners to heat the air already inside. As the air gets hotter, the balloon expands and becomes lighter than the air outside. This makes it lift off the ground and float up high!

To make the balloon come back down, the pilot stops heating the air. As the balloon air cools, the balloon becomes heavier than the air around it. This makes it gently drift back to the ground. Many hot air balloon rides happen at sunrise or sunset when winds are calm. Passengers enjoy peaceful views from up above. The pilot must carefully check weather conditions first for a safe flight. Hot air ballooning is a unique way to see beautiful landscapes from the sky.
