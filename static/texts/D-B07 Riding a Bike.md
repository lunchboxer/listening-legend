# Riding a Bike

I just learned how to ride a bike! First, my dad took off the training wheels. He told me to sit on the seat and put my feet on the pedals. Then he pushed the bike to get me started. I wobbled a little bit at first. My dad ran beside me, holding onto the back of the seat to keep me steady. After a few tries, I could balance by myself!

Now I can ride all around our neighborhood. I have to be very careful to watch for cars and stop at stop signs. Sometimes I ride fast and feel the wind on my face. Other times I ride slowly to look at the trees and flowers. Riding my bike makes me feel big and free. I can't wait to go on a bike ride tomorrow!
