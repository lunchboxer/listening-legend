# Vikings

The Vikings were adventurous seafarers and fierce raiders. Around 1200 years ago, they came from the Nordic countries of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. The Vikings were skilled boat builders and sailors. They traveled far across the seas in their longships raiding distant lands.

The Vikings launched raids on coastal towns in England, France, Spain, and beyond. They went in search of riches and new territory to plunder. With their swift ships, the Vikings could strike quickly and disappear before defense forces arrived. They became greatly feared through stories of their ferocious attacks.

However, the Vikings were more than just warriors and raiders. They were also traders, explorers, and colonists. Viking ships traded goods like fur, tusks, and seal fat across Europe. Some sailed west and discovered Iceland, Greenland, and even North America! Over time, many Vikings settled peacefully in the new lands they found.
