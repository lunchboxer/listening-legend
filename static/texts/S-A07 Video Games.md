# Video Games

Video games are electronic games played using a controller and screen. Early games like Pong and Pac-Man became popular in the 1970s and 80s. As technology improved, games became more complex and realistic. Today, games are played on consoles like Xbox and PlayStation, and computers, phones and tablets.

Popular genres include action, adventure, sports, roleplaying and puzzle games. Action games involve fighting or shooting. Adventure games have storylines to follow. Sports games simulate real sports like soccer, basketball or racing. In roleplaying games, players take on a character. Puzzle games challenge problem solving. Multiplayer games allow interaction from different devices.

Games require eye-hand coordination and quick decisions. They can improve visual attention and reaction time. However, itâ€™s important to take breaks from gaming and not play too many hours in a row. Moderation is key to balance gaming and other activities.
