# Satellites

Satellites are objects launched into space that orbit around the Earth. Some look like large metal boxes. Others can be as small as a loaf of bread! Satellites are used for different purposes.

Communication satellites relay radio, television, and phone signals around the world. Weather satellites take pictures of clouds to help forecast storms. GPS satellites help ships, planes, and cars know exactly where they are. Other satellites study stars and planets.

Without satellites, we wouldn't have satellite TV, accurate maps and navigation, or as much information about space. Satellites are important technology high above Earth!
