# The Titanic

The Titanic was a huge ship that was built in 1912. It was supposed to be the most luxurious and safest ship ever made. It had four funnels, three propellers, and could carry over 2,000 passengers and crew. It also had many features, such as a swimming pool, a gym, a library, and a grand staircase. The Titanic was called the "unsinkable" ship, because it had a special system of watertight compartments that would prevent it from sinking.

However, on its maiden voyage from England to New York, the Titanic hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean. The collision caused the ship's hull to rupture and water to flood the compartments. The Titanic did not have enough lifeboats for everyone on board, and many people panicked and tried to escape. The ship broke in half and sank in less than three hours, killing more than 1,500 people. The Titanic was one of the worst maritime disasters in history.
