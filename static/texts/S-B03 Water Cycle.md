# The Water Cycle

The water cycle is how water moves around the earth. Water can be a liquid, a solid, or a gas. Liquid water is in oceans, lakes, and rivers. Solid water is ice and snow. Gas water is water vapor in the air.

The sun heats up the liquid water and turns it into gas water. This is called evaporation. The gas water rises up into the sky and forms clouds. This is called condensation. When the clouds get too heavy, they drop liquid water or solid water as rain, snow, or hail. This is called precipitation. The water then flows back into the oceans, lakes, and rivers, and the cycle starts again.
