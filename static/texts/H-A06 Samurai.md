# Samurai

Samurai were the warriors and nobility of ancient Japan. They followed a code of honor called bushido that focused on loyalty, courage, and discipline. Samurai trained from childhood to master the sword along with other weapons. Their skills and moral code made them feared warriors.

Samurai first appeared around 700 AD. As wars raged between rival clans, local lords hired warriors for protection. Over time, a band of loyal fighters emerged to give their lives for their lord. By the 1200s, samurai ruled much of Japan with their lords.

Samurai wore elaborate armor and masks into battle. Their weapons included swords, bows, spears. They practiced discipline and meditation. Though fierce in battle, samurai also studied arts and music. Their era ended in the late 1800s with reforms dissolving the samurai class.
