# Languages Around the World

Do you like to talk with your friends and family? Do you know that there are many different languages in the world? A language is a way of speaking and writing that people use to communicate. Some languages use the same letters as English, but some use different symbols or sounds. For example, in Chinese, people write with characters that look like pictures. In Arabic, people write from right to left. In Spanish, people say "hola" to greet each other.

There are more than 7,000 languages in the world, but not all of them are spoken by many people. Some languages are very popular and have millions of speakers, such as English, Mandarin, Hindi, and Spanish. Some languages are only spoken by a few people, such as Hawaiian, Welsh, and Basque. Some languages are even in danger of disappearing, because the people who speak them are switching to other languages. That is why it is important to learn about different languages and cultures, and to respect them.
