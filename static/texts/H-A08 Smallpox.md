# Eradicating Smallpox

Smallpox was a deadly disease that killed millions of people worldwide. It caused a severe rash and flu-like symptoms. There was no cure for smallpox, only vaccination to try and prevent it. Smallpox spread easily from one person to another through the air. Major outbreaks occurred frequently for thousands of years.

In the 1960s, doctors were still working to control smallpox around the world. At this time, the World Health Organization launched a plan to completely eradicate the disease. Teams traveled, testing and vaccinating people everywhere. They tracked down cases and vaccinated everyone the sick had contacted.

It took over 10 years of dedicated effort across many countries. Finally, in 1980 the World Health Organization declared that smallpox had been totally wiped out globally! It was an amazing achievement. Smallpox became the first and so far only human disease to be eradicated. Vaccination stopped its spread for good.
