# The Sahara Desert

The Sahara Desert is a huge desert in Africa. It covers about 3.5 million square miles. That is almost as big as the whole United States! The Sahara gets very little rain. In some years, some parts get no rain at all. The Sahara has very few plants. There are some small shrubs and short grass in a few places. It is too dry for many plants to grow.

People have lived in the Sahara for thousands of years. Long ago, the climate was wetter. There were lakes and rivers. Ancient rock art shows that elephants, rhinos and other animals once lived there. Today, camels are one of the main animals that can survive in the harsh desert. About 2.5 million people still live in the Sahara. They are nomads who move around to find water and grass for their animals.
