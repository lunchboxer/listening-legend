# Karst Mountains in China

China has many tall mountains, but some of the most special are the karst mountains in the south of the country. Karst landscapes are formed when water dissolves soluble rocks like limestone. This creates amazing shapes, cliffs, caves and sinkholes in the landscape.

The stone forests in Yunnan Province are one famous example. These forests are filled with hundreds of narrow, stone pillars that look like tree trunks. Some of the pillars are over 100 feet tall! The stone forests were created over millions of years as rainwater eroded away the soft limestone.

Another famous karst landscape is the Reed Flute Cave near Guilin City. The cave has spectacular stalactites, stalagmites and other rock formations. These were also formed by dripping rainwater. The cave gets its name from the reeds that grow near the entrance, which people used to make flutes.
