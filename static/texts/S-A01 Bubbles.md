# Bubbles

A bubble is a pocket of air that gets sealed up inside a thin layer of soap and water. When you blow into bubble solution using a bubble wand or form bubbles with soapy water and your hands, a stretchy bubble starts to take shape. The soapy water surrounds the air and forms a flexible bubble wall.

Bubbles come in all shapes and sizes. Some are small and spherical. When lots of bubbles stick together, they can form cool bubble shapes like long snake bubbles or giant bubble walls. The coolest bubble tricks happen when the bubble solution, airflow, and weather conditions are just right. On bright sunny days with no wind, giant bubbles can last for minutes before popping!
