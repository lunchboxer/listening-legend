# Going to the Zoo

Today we are going to the zoo! I am so excited. First, we get in the car and drive to the zoo. When we get there, we have to wait in a long line to buy tickets. Finally, we get inside the zoo!

The first animals we see are the monkeys. They are silly and make funny noises. I laugh when I see the monkeys swinging and playing. Next, we walk over to the lions. One big lion is taking a nap in the sunshine. His mate and cubs are playing nearby. The lion cubs are so cute! Their fur is fluffy.

After the lions, we go see my favorite animals - the elephants! They use their trunks to pick up food and put it in their mouths. The baby elephant sprays water on its back to keep cool. Seeing the elephants makes me happy. Going to the zoo is so much fun!
