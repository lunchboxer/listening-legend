# Fossils

Fossils are the remains or traces of plants and animals that lived long ago. Fossils can be bones, shells, teeth, or even footprints. Fossils help scientists learn about the past. For example, fossils can tell us what dinosaurs looked like, what they ate, and how they moved.

Fossils are usually found in rocks that were once underwater. When a plant or animal died, it sank to the bottom of the sea. Layers of sand and mud covered it. Over time, these layers turned into rock. The plant or animal parts also turned into rock. Sometimes, the plant or animal parts dissolved and left a hole in the rock. This is called a mold. Sometimes, new minerals filled the hole and made a copy of the plant or animal part. This is called a cast.
