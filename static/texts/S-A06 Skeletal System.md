# The Skeletal System

Your skeletal system is made up of all the bones in your body. These bones form the skeleton which provides structure and protection. Some bones protect your important organs like the brain and lungs. Other bones allow you to move parts of your body.

There are over 200 bones in the human skeleton. The largest bone is the femur in your thigh. The smallest are tiny bones in the ear. Bones are made of a tough material called calcium that makes them hard and strong. Bones connect to each other at joints, which allow different types of movement like bending, twisting and rotating. Major joints are found at the shoulders, hips, elbows and knees.

Bones also make blood cells, store minerals and allow you to move. Without a skeletal system, humans would not be able to walk, run, jump or move much at all! It is an important system that provides both structure and movement to the body.
