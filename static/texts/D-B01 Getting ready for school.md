# Getting Ready for School

Getting ready for school in the morning is fun! First, I wake up and get dressed. I put on my favorite t-shirt and some cozy jeans. Then I go eat breakfast. My favorite breakfast is a waffle with strawberries on top. After breakfast, I brush my teeth to get clean and healthy. Next, I put on my jacket and shoes so I’m ready to go. I make sure to put my homework in my backpack so I’m all set for school. I always get excited when my mom says it’s time to go to school!
