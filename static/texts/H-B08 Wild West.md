# The Wild West

In the late 1800s, the Wild West was a frontier area of the United States west of the Mississippi River. It was wild country filled with adventure.

Many pioneers traveled west in covered wagons to start new farms and towns. Outlaws and gunfighters like Billy the Kid roamed the land too. Lawmen were sheriffs and marshals who kept the peace.

Ranchers herded cattle over open plains. Cowboys became icons of the West, riding horses and roping cattle. Native Americans like Sitting Bull fought to protect their homelands as settlers moved in.

The Wild West came alive through stories, movies, and TV shows. Names like Sheriff Wyatt Earp, Calamity Jane, and Jesse James remain famous today. The spirit of the rugged, adventurous Wild West lives on.
