# Renewable Energy

Renewable energy comes from natural sources that replenish themselves. Types include solar, wind, water, geothermal and biomass. Solar cells convert sunlight into electricity. Wind turbines use wind motion to generate electricity. Hydropower plants use flowing water to produce power. Biomass uses plants and waste to make energy.

Fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas are limited. They create pollution but renewable energy is cleaner. Solar and wind farms can provide electricity without access to power grids. As technology improves, renewables are becoming more efficient and affordable globally.

Using more renewables can reduce greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Many countries aim to increase renewable energy and reduce fossil fuel reliance. Individuals can also install solar panels to support the transition.
