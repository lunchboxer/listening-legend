# Playing Soccer

I started playing soccer this year on a team. At our first practice, the coach taught us how to dribble the ball up and down the field. It was tricky at first! I had to use the inside of my foot to keep the ball close.

Now we have games every weekend. All the players on both teams wear jerseys and shin guards. The referee blows the whistle and the game starts! My favorite position is forward because I can try to score goals. I kick the ball as hard as I can toward the net. Sometimes I miss and have to chase the ball down. Playing soccer is tiring but really fun! After each game, we shake hands with the other team.
