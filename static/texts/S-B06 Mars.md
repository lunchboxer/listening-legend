# Mars

Mars is a planet in our solar system. It is red and rocky. Mars is smaller than Earth. Mars is also colder than Earth because it is farther from the Sun. Mars has large volcanoes, deep canyons, and giant dust storms. But Mars does not have any oceans or much air.

Some robots called rovers explore Mars. The rovers drive around the planet and take photos. They dig up and study Martian soil and rocks. The rovers send information back to Earth. One day, people may visit and live on Mars! But they will need spacesuits when outside because there is little air to breathe.
