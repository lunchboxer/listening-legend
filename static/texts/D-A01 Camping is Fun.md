# Camping is Fun

Camping is a fun way to spend time outside. When going camping, it’s important to pack the right gear. You’ll want to bring a tent to sleep in, a sleeping bag to sleep on, and a flashlight so you can see at night. Don’t forget warm clothes and rain gear in case the weather gets bad. It's also important to bring enough food and water for the length of your trip. Keep food in sealable bags or containers so animals don’t smell and try to get it. Some good camping foods that don’t need refrigeration are trail mix, beef jerky, canned goods, and cereal bars. With the right gear and good planning, camping can make for great weekend adventures and memories that last a lifetime.
